## Description of the Project
The Alx AirBnB clone project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the  AirBnB website. At the end of the project we'll have a complete web application composed by:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### Description of the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a custom shell designed using cmd module. The custom shell lets a user work with a program interactively. It makes it easy to make command line interfaces in programs
